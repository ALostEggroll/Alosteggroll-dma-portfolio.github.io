    I'm Christian Acosta, a filpino immigrant raised in San Jose, California. I come from a traditional animation background and I love animating my work using maya, after effects, and photoshop. Most of my art work consists of comedy, animations, video game projects, and bringing awareness to social equality and climate change. I've seen first hand how stress can make people sad or angry, so I believe I can help others enjoy life by laughing at the humor in some of my works. On the other hand, I also believe some issues can't be solved by laughing it off. So I adapt my work depending on the current mood of the world. If we're too angry I'll make you laugh, but if we're too content I'll make you aware.

During my time in SJSU I have been mainly active in the GameDev club learning about game design and using video games as an artistic medium to make art and experiment with storytelling and subject matter. Most of my work is 2D, but I want to develop my 3D skills and develop 3D games, 3D art, and 3D animations. My goal is to further develop my video game art assets and work in a video game company as an artist or designer. In addition, I'm interested in learning about 3D printing and learning about AR and VR using my knowledge in 3D art as a base.
</p>
<p style="color:white;">
Another subject I have been interested in is motion graphics as this builds off of my animation background. I created my first motion graphic project <i>2020</i> that focuses on the subject matter and the type of animation associated with it. I plan on getting a minor in graphic design to refine my understanding of design and enhance my motion graphic skills. Hopefully, this can make me more marketable in job hunts doing motion graphics and graphic designs for employers. I also plan on using my interest in motion graphics and graphic design to explore UX/UI design and develop interesting websites, apps, or help develop brands or something similar. Also, I plan on using my knowledge from after effects to explore special effects for videos.

The thing I love about DMA is the variety, yet intertwined focuses. I want to focus more on the 3D mediums of DMA and explore job opportunities within the 3D world, but my main goal for learning 3D art is to one day land a job in the video game industry. Additionally, learning motion graphics and design can help me become more versatile in the job market. Using DMA also helps project my artistic voice through new digital mediums. DMA has allowed me to be myself and create fun and entertaining art that makes people laugh and other times I can make interesting art that brings awareness to current problems. DMA is a fun and interesting major with so much to learn about.
