  <h4 style="color:white;">Pleased to meet you and thank you for visiting my portfoliio!</h4>
  <p style="color:white;">
    I am Christian Acosta, a Digital Media Artist currently attending San Jose State University. I'm a Filipino immigrant born in the metropolitan capital city of Manila Philippines and raised in the
    lovely city of San Jose, California. I come from a traditional animation background in highschool and took some filmmaking
    and 3D classes at De Anza community college.
</p>

    <p style="color:white;">
Most of my work is intended to make people laugh because I believe during these stressed out times we need comedy more than ever
to bring us back to the good old days. On the other hand I also believe some issues can't be solved by simply laughing it off, but
helping bring awareness to the topic can invite conversations about said topic. So I adapt my work depending on the current mood of
the world. If we're too stressed or angry, I'll make you laugh; but if we're too content, I'll make you aware.
</p>

During my time in SJSU I have been mainly active in the GameDev club learning about game design and using video games as an artistic
medium to make art and experiment with storytelling and subject matter. Most of my work is 2D, but I want to develop my 3D skills and
develop 3D games, 3D art, and 3D animations. My goal is to further develop my video game art assets and work in a video game company as
an artist or designer. In addition, I'm interested in learning about 3D printing and learning about AR and VR using my knowledge in 3D art
as a base.
</p>

<p style="color:white;">
Another subject I have been interested in is motion graphics as this builds off of my animation background. I created my first motion
graphic project <i>2020</i> that focuses on the subject matter and the type of animation associated with it. I plan on getting a minor in
graphic design to refine my understanding of design and enhance my motion graphic skills. Hopefully, this can make me more marketable
in job hunts doing motion graphics and graphic designs for employers. I also plan on using my interest in motion graphics and graphic
design to explore UX/UI design and develop interesting websites, apps, or help develop brands or something similar. Also, I plan on using
my knowledge from after effects to explore special effects for videos.
</p>

<p style="color:white;">
The thing I love about DMA is the variety, yet intertwined focuses. I want to focus more on the 3D mediums of DMA and explore job
opportunities within the 3D world, but my main goal for learning 3D art is to one day land a job in the video game industry. Additionally,
learning motion graphics and design can help me become more versatile in the job market. Using DMA also helps project my artistic voice
through new digital mediums. DMA has allowed me to be myself and create fun and entertaining art that makes people laugh and other times
I can make interesting art that brings awareness to current topics. Overall, DMA is a fun and interesting major with so many interesting
classes I want to learn about and hopefully land a job and help others who also want to learn about DMA.
